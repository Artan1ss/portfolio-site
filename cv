 Dear Hiring Manager,
 I'm excited to apply for the Java Full Stack Developer position at Infosys because I 
believe my background and skills align perfectly with what you're looking for. With a 
Master's degree in Computer Engineering from New York University and extensive 
experience in full-stack development, I've honed my ability to deliver high-quality 
software solutions that drive real value. At Donovan's Venom, I collaborated with a team 
to create a web-based music education platform that served over 100 users seamlessly. 
This experience taught me the importance of scalability and reliability, which I know are 
essential for the role at Infosys.
 In a past capstone project with United Airlines, I developed a web application that 
provided auditors with quick access to essential documentation, boosting operational 
efficiency by 70%. My hands-on experience with technologies like Java, Angular, and 
RESTful APIs has prepared me to tackle the demands of the Software Development 
Life Cycle. I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity at Infosys to work with diverse 
stakeholders and contribute to high-level design artifacts—something I excel at, as 
seen in my previous roles.
 I also understand that communication is key in a global delivery environment. My ability 
to articulate complex technical concepts in a simple manner has helped me work 
effectively with cross-functional teams. I'm eager to bring this experience to Infosys 
and contribute to a learning culture where collaboration thrives. I'm flexible and ready 
to adapt to the needs of the team, whether that means coding late nights or traveling 
as required. I'm looking forward to the possibility of contributing my skills to Infosys and 
being part of such an esteemed organization.
 Sincerely,
 Xuefeng Sun
